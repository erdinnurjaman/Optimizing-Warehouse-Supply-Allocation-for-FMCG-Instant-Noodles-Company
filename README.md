# Optimizing Warehouse Supply Allocation for FMCG Instant Noodles Company 🍜
This project analyzes the mismatch between demand and supply in FMCG warehouses using a combination of Python and Power BI. The analysis is done using descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analytics approaches to optimize product distribution and warehouse efficiency. The results are visualized in an interactive dashboard as a management decision-making tool.
## 1. Background Information 📋
FMCG companies that have only been in the instant noodle business for two years are experiencing a mismatch between demand and supply of products in various warehouses. When demand is high, supply is low, and vice versa. This causes significant inventory cost losses. 
Therefore, management wants to understand more deeply the demand patterns and warehouse conditions in 
various regions in order to optimize product distribution.
## 2. Project Objective 🎯
Perform historical data analysis to: <br>
• Identify product demand patterns by region, location type, and 
warehouse characteristics. <br>
• Diagnose factors causing demand and supply mismatch. <br>
• Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize supply allocation and 
support managerial decision making through interactive dashboards. <br>

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis 1 - Problem Discovery in Data Sets 📈  
### A. Descriptive Statistic  
- There is no issue with the data type in each column. However, there are several columns that have missing values, namely <mark>**workers_num**</mark>, <mark>**wh_est_year**</mark>, and <mark>**approved_wh_govt_certificate**</mark>. These columns need to be further analyzed for imputation purposes.
![df_isna](Assets/df_isna.png)  
- All data from the numeric columns starting from the average, minimum value, median and maximum value have no anomalies or irregularities, everything looks normal. But there are some columns whose minimum and maximum values are always 0 and 1, namely <mark>flood_impacted</mark>, <mark>flood_proof</mark>, <mark>electric_supply</mark>, and <mark>temp_reg_mach</mark>. These columns contain nominal data, namely data that is only used to label or categorize without order. In the data transformation section, we will process and map it to the defined value. In the <mark>Competitor_in_mkt</mark> column, there are several values that have very little data and are not representative for visualization, we can create a segmentation for values that are more than or equal to 9.
- Put aside the Ware_House_ID and WH_Manager_ID columns because they are identifier or key data for each row. What is interesting is the Location_type column, where from the composition of the column values, the majority of warehouses are located in rural areas. The other columns still look normal.
### B. Univariate Analysis
- After seeing the results of the boxplot and distplot, there are several columns that have outliers, namely transport_issue_l1y, competitor_in_mkt, retail_shop_num and workers_num and the 4 columns have a positive or positively skew distribution. These columns are interesting for us to do a deeper analysis in the next section, namely Bivariate Analysis.
- As previously stated, the Location Type column is quite interesting because of the disparity in value between Rural and Urban. This column could be something interesting to do further analysis regarding the cause.

## 6. Data Cleaning & Transformation 🧹🧼✨  
### A. Imputation on Missing Values  
- Because the missing values ​​in the workers_num column were previously assumed to be because the warehouse was newly established or had not been recorded, but after checking with the warehouse establishment year column, it turned out that the distribution of the missing value data was random, so it will be imputed with the median of the WH_Capacity_Size group.
- For imputation on the wh_est_year column, it will be done by using the median value of all wh_est_year values ​​in the dataframe because it is normal in terms of distribution. But before that, flagging is done first to mark the rows whose wh_est_year is imputed, if later a more in-depth analysis is needed on warehouses whose year of establishment is empty.
- For the imputation of the approved_wh_govt_certificate column, an approach will be taken to create a new value, namely "Not Yet Certified" or "Unknown" so that it still appears in the visual.
### B. Mapping column values  
For the Competitor_in_mkt column, we create a new segmentation, namely ">= 9" for competitor values greater than or equal to 9 and the value 0 is combined with the value 1 and for value mapping in columns that contain nominal data but have not been defined, here is the mapping:  
  
flood_impacted:  
0: Not Impacted Area  
1: Impacted Area  
  
flood_proof:  
0: Not Flood Proof  
1: Flood Proof  
  
electric_supply:  
0: No Backup Power  
1: Has Backup Power  
  
temp_reg_mach:  
0: No Temperature Regulation  
1: Has Temperature Regulation

### A. Product Weight Shipped VS Storage Issue Reported Last 3 Months  
Warehouses with high shipping volumes tend to experience and report storage issues more frequently. This shows the importance of adaptive capacity management and storage infrastructure for high-performance warehouses.
