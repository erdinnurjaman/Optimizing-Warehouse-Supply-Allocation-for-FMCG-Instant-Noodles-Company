# Optimizing Warehouse Supply Allocation for FMCG Instant Noodles Company
This project analyzes the mismatch between demand and supply in FMCG warehouses using a combination of Python and Power BI. The analysis is done using descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analytics approaches to optimize product distribution and warehouse efficiency. The results are visualized in an interactive dashboard as a management decision-making tool.
## 1. Background Information
FMCG companies that have only been in the instant noodle business for two years are experiencing a mismatch between demand and supply of products in various warehouses. When demand is high, supply is low, and vice versa. This causes significant inventory cost losses. 
Therefore, management wants to understand more deeply the demand patterns and warehouse conditions in 
various regions in order to optimize product distribution.
## 2. Project Objective
Perform historical data analysis to: 
• Identify product demand patterns by region, location type, and 
warehouse characteristics. 
• Diagnose factors causing demand and supply mismatch. 
• Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize supply allocation and 
support managerial decision making through interactive dashboards.
